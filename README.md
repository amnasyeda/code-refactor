# code-refactor
The first assignment for UofT Bootcamp which is an HTML-CSS-Git Challenge. Purpose: to recode a webpage in order to be functional through all links; it must also look professional and attractive. The project mocked a real-world client assignment, essentially demonstrating one's abilities to contrive a functioning webpage.
